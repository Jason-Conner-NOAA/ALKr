ALKr 0.2
========

* Now using Rcpp. `gascuel` is the first algorithm partially implemented in C++,
  resulting in a median speedup of about 15x.
* Removed `age_classes` and `length_classes` slot from the 'ALKr' class, as they
  are redundant. All methods generating `ALKr` objects are assumed to pass them
  as respectively column and rownames of the `alk` slot.

ALKr 0.1
========

* Initial version.
